# Text-to-Image-Synthesis [In Progress]
Pytorch implementation of Generative Adversarial Text-to-Image Synthesis paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05396

## ToDo:
- Improve the method of sampling image, text pairs **[x]**
- Normalize images between -1 and 1 **[x]**
- Implement GAN_CLS_INT
- Try Upsampling and compare it to Deconv
- Implement Label smoothing **[x]**
- Improve the method of sampling image, text pairs
- Normalize images between -1 and 1
